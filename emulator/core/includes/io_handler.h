/*
 * The peripheral selection is done via a 74138 (3 to 8 demultiplexer)
 * The selection of a peripheral is made by placing a 3 bit value on  A4 to A6 (A7 is reserved
 * for possible external peripheral)
 * The value placed on A0 to A3 (4bits, 16 possibilities) can then be used to select a register on
 * a chip, toggle something or whatever the peripheral does with it.
 *
 * Note : A8 to A15 is not used since the IN and OUT instructions uses only the lower part of the
 * address line.
 *
 * 0 = MMU
 * 1 = SERIAL
 * 2 = CTC
 * 3 = AY
 * 4 = VDP
